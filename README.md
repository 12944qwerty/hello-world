# Hello Github!

Hello! I am 12944qwerty!
I love coding for fun but have barely any experience at all! If you would like to help me, that would be awesome! 
I know some:
- HTML and CSS - more than 50% (hopefully)
- Python - Still Learning
- Javascript - Just started (mostly through analyzing other scripts)
